## 🎯 Scoring Algorithm

RepoRadar uses a sophisticated scoring system that considers multiple factors:

```
Score = NameMatch(40pts) + DescriptionMatch(30pts) + TopicMatch(20pts) + PopularityBonus(10pts)
```

### **Scoring Breakdown:**
1. **Name Match (40 points)**: Does the repo name contain query keywords?
2. **Description Match (30 points)**: How many query words appear in the description?
3. **Topic Match (20 points)**: Do repository topics align with the query?
4. **Popularity Bonus (10 points)**: Logarithmic bonus based on stars (more stars = higher quality)
